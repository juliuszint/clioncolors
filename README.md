# Visual Studio 2015 (with Resharper) colorscheme for CLion IDE
Since i grown very fund of the Visual Studio colorscheme with the additional Colors brought in by the installation of Resharper i decided to take them with me onto OS X and CLion. Only tested with some C++ so take it with a grain of salt.
